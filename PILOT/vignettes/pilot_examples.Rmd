# Introduction

In this vignette we illustrate the use of the pilot package for training linear
model trees using the PILOT algorithm. 


# mtcars data

We will illustrate pilot on the mtcars data. First load the data

```{r}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
```


In order to use it properly, we need to make sure that the categorical variables are encoded as factors in the data frame.
This is absolutely crucial, since pilot does not fit linear models to categorical variables.

```{r}
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs, labels = c("V", "S"))
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("auto", "manual"))
```


Now we will define a response and a set of predictors. For illustrative purposes, we select mpg as the response.

```{r}
X <- mtcars[, -1]
y <- mtcars[, 1]
```

Now we can train the linear model tree using PILOT.
```{r}
pilot.out <- pilot(X, y)
```


We can extract the residuals and plot them.

```{r}
plot(pilot.out$residuals)
```


First print the resulting object. This gives a matrix representation of the linear model tree.
We can see the first split was a broken linear model on feature 2 (displacement), with split value 121.
Then the left node was a leaf node. The right node went on to fit one more linear model on the 
10th feature (Number of carburetors), and then became a leaf node as well.


```{r}
print(pilot.out)
```

Instead of printing, we can plot the object.


```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
plot(pilot.out)
```


Or we can plot the variable importances in the leaf nodes. The corresponding
bars are colored in red if the coefficient is negative, and blue if it is a positive
coefficient:

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
plot(pilot.out, infoType = 1)
```



In order to make new predictions with the model, we can use the predict function.
It is crucial that the newdata argument is again a data frame with the same variable names
in the same order and of the same type as the original data. If not, an error will be thrown.

```{r} 
preds.out <- predict(pilot.out, newdata = X)
plot(preds.out, y); abline(0,1)
```
